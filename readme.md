# 🚀 Building an LLM from Scratch

## 📌 Overview
This repository is dedicated to building a **Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch**, inspired by **Sebastian Raschka's book**. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts behind modern LLMs by implementing key components from the ground up.

## 📖 Motivation
With the rise of powerful LLMs like GPT, understanding their inner workings is crucial for researchers and developers. Instead of relying solely on pre-built models, this project aims to break down the architecture, training methodologies, and optimizations that power these models.

## 🛠️ Features & Roadmap
- [ ] **Tokenization** – Implementing custom tokenizers and handling different vocabularies.
- [ ] **Embeddings** – Word embeddings and positional encodings.
- [ ] **Transformer Architecture** – Building attention mechanisms and feed-forward layers.
- [ ] **Training Pipeline** – Implementing a scalable training loop with optimizations.
- [ ] **Evaluation & Fine-tuning** – Assessing performance and fine-tuning the model.
- [ ] **Deployment** – Exploring ways to serve the trained LLM efficiently.

## 📚 References
- **Sebastian Raschka's book** (add the exact title)
- Research papers on Transformers and Language Models
- Open-source implementations like GPT-2, BERT, and LLaMA
